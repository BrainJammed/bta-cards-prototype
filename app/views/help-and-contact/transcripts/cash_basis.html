        <p>Cash basis and simplified expenses are two income tax schemes that can make life easier for self-employed businesses.</p>

        <p>Instead of using traditional accounting rules, cash basis can be used if you’re a self-employed business or partnership with a total annual business income of £150,000 or less.</p>

        <p>You’ll only be taxed on the money that comes in and goes out of your business during the tax year. This will be easier to calculate and save you time.
        </p>

        <p>Cash basis doesn’t suit all businesses. It can limit claims to some expenses and losses.</p>

        <p>Simplified expenses can be used by all self-employed businesses and partnerships which don’t have limited companies as partners.</p>

        <p>They’re a way of working out some of your allowable business expenses using flat rates. It’s easier than using your actual business costs, which can be difficult to work out.
        </p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Flat rates can be used for business costs for</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>some vehicles</li>
          <li>working from home</li>
          <li>and living at your business premises</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need to record</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your vehicle’s business miles</li>
          <li>the hours you work at home</li>
          <li>and how many people live at your business premises over the year</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can then apply the flat rate to work out your expenses at the end of the tax year.</p>



        <p>You can find more information about these schemes on
