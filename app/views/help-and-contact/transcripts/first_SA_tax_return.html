        <p>Do you need to complete a Self Assessment tax return?</p>

        <p>To help you find out, you can check on
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> by answering some questions.
        </p>

        <p>If you do need to complete a tax return, you must do it or you could be fined, even if you don’t owe any tax.</p>

        <p>The tax year ends on the fifth of April and you need to register for Self Assessment by the fifth of October, or you may be charged a penalty.
          You can register on
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> – there’s another short You Tube video that explains how to do this.
        </p>

        <p>Your tax return, which covers the tax year that ended in April, is due by the thirty first of January the following year.
          Once you’ve registered and activated your online account, you’re ready to start.
        </p>

        <p>Make sure you’ve got your information and records to hand, as you’ll need to fill in details of all your income.</p>

        <p>Go to
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> and login with the user ID and password you received when you registered online.
        </p>

        <p>First, we’ll need some details about you. The online screens will guide you – if you get stuck, there are prompts on screen and
          links that explain more. For example, if you enter your date of birth the wrong way, the box will light up red.
        </p>

        <p>In the section called Tailor your return you answer yes or no to a series of questions – this means you only fill in the sections that apply to you.
          If you’re not sure about a question, click on the ‘Help about’ link for guidance.
        </p>

        <p>The Save and continue button will save what you’ve entered so far; it’s handy if you want to stop and come back to it later.</p>

        <p>When you’ve completed your return, check it through. You can go back if you need to correct anything.</p>

        <p>Use View your calculation to find out if you owe tax and how much.</p>

        <p>Now you can save a copy for your records. In the Submit return section, you’ll need your user ID and password to send it to HMRC.
           Finally, you’ll get an online message to confirm that we’ve received it.
        </p>

        <p>You can find out more about Self Assessment on
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> and watch our other helpful videos and webinars on YouTube.
