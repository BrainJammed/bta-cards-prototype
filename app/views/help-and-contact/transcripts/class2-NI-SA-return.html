        <p>If you’re self-employed or in a partnership, you pay Class 2 National Insurance to qualify for State Pension and other benefits.
          Most people pay this in their Self Assessment payment – by 31 January, following the end of the tax year.
        </p>

        <p>You must pay if your profits are at, or above, the Small Profits Threshold – you can find the current rates on
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
        </p>

        <p>When you’re self-employed, to pay Class 2 National Insurance, you need to register for Self Assessment.
          You also need to do this when your annual turnover is below a thousand pounds and you want to pay voluntary contributions.
        </p>

        <p>On your tax return, select self-employed or in a partnership – this is the section where your Class 2 contributions are included.</p>

        <p>Your return shows the amount due, based on the number of weeks in the tax year you were self-employed on your National Insurance records.</p>

        <p>You will tailor your tax return on the first 3 pages. Use this section to tell us about your different types of income, employments and self-employments so that you only see the parts of the tax return that you need to.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If the amount shows ‘Not available, check help’:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you may not be registered correctly for self-employment, so you’ll need to register on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> or</li>
          <li>the service may be unavailable. When it’s available select the ‘Recalculate’ button to show the amount due.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">If the amount shows zero, this may be because:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>you’re not registered correctly for self-employment</li>
          <li>you’ve already paid the maximum National Insurance</li>
          <li>you received certain benefits meaning no Class 2 is due</li>
          <li>you were abroad and pay Class 2 differently</li>
        </ul>

       <p>If you’re not sure, contact the National Insurance helpline.</p>

       <p>If you started or stopped self-employment during the year and think the amount is incorrect, select the ‘Update your self-employment
         details’ link to update your record, then select ‘Recalculate’.</p>

       <p>To make voluntary Class 2 payments, select ‘Yes’, otherwise select ‘No’.</p>

       <p>Your full calculation shows how much tax and National Insurance you owe.</p>

       <p>You can find more information about Self Assessment on
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
