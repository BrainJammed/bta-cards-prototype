        <p>You’re self-employed which means you have essential costs to keep your business running.
          You can deduct these costs which are called allowable expenses to work out your taxable profit.
        </p>

        <p>But remember – if you’re using the £1000 tax-free trading allowance, you can’t claim any expenses.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Allowable expenses include:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>office property and equipment</li>
          <li>travel, including cars and vans</li>
          <li>staff</li>
          <li>any legal and financial costs</li>
          <li>and also marketing and subscriptions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">You can’t claim for anything you spend on personal things, such as:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>your home and accommodation</li>
          <li>food</li>
          <li>clothing</li>
          <li>holidays</li>
          <li>and anything you buy for you and your family</li>
        </ul>

       <p>You may want to use simplified expenses – this means you claim a flat rate instead of working out the actual costs.
         For example, for car travel you can claim 45 pence a mile up to 10,000 miles and then 25 pence a mile over this amount.
       </p>

       <p>If your income is £85,000 or more, you’ll need to list each expense individually under the appropriate heading.
         This also applies if you didn’t trade a full year but would have earned this amount or more if you had – for example,
         your income for 6 months was £50,000 – so in 12 months it would have been £100,000.
       </p>

       <p>If your income is less than £85,000, it’s up to you whether you give us your total amount of expenses or list them individually.</p>

       <p>It’s important you keep records and proof of your business costs – you’ll need them to complete your Self Assessment tax return.
         Sometimes we ask to see these, but please don’t send them with your return.
       </p>
