        <p class="govuk-body">You may need to register for Self Assessment if you’re:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>self-employed</li>
          <li>a partner in a partnership</li>
          <li>or for another reason such as untaxed income</li>
        </ul>

       <p>If you didn’t send a tax return last year, you need to register by 5th October following the end of the tax year.</p>

       <p>Here, we’ll explain the different ways to register.</p>

       <p class="govuk-body">If you’re self-employed, you’ll need to register:</p>
       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
         <li>if your turnover is more than a thousand pounds in a tax year</li>
         <li>to prove you’re self-employed</li>
         <li>or to pay voluntary Class 2 National Insurance contributions</li>
       </ul>

       <p>If you’ve sent a tax return before, but didn’t last year, use your existing Self Assessment Unique Taxpayer
         Reference, or UTR – and re-register online using form CWF1.
       </p>

       <p>Otherwise, register online.</p>

       <p>We’ll send you a letter with your UTR and set up your account for the Self Assessment online service.
         You’ll get another letter a few days later with a code to activate your online service. Use this the first
         time you sign in.
       </p>

       <p>Partnerships must be registered by a nominated partner, but each partner needs to register individually as
         well – using form SA401 and the UTR for the partnership.
       </p>

       <p>If you need to register for another reason, use form SA1.</p>

       <p>Once you’ve registered, if you already have a UTR and online account, you can use them to send your online tax return.</p>
       <p>If not, we’ll send your UTR in the post within ten working days.</p>
       <p>Use your UTR to create a new online account and sign up for the Self Assessment online service.
         We’ll then send you a code to activate your account within seven working days of signing up.
       </p>
       <p>You can find out more about Self Assessment on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> and watch our other helpful videos on YouTube.</p>
