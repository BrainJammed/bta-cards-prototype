        <p>You’ll usually be sent a tax return if you’re registered as self-employed, but there are plenty of other reasons why you may need to fill one in.
          You can check if you need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return quickly and easily on
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a> using the link at the end of this video.
        </p>

        <p>It’s not connected to HM Revenue and Customs online services so it’s completely anonymous</p>

        <p>If you’re sent a tax return, or if you get an email or letter from HMRC telling you to complete one, you must do it - even
          if you don’t have any tax to pay. If you don’t send a tax return back by the deadline you may have to pay a penalty.
        </p>

        <p>If you used to send a tax return but don’t need to send one for the last tax year, contact HMRC to close your Self Assessment account.</p>

        <p>You must also tell HMRC if you’ve stopped being self-employed. You can do all this – and find out much more – on
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
