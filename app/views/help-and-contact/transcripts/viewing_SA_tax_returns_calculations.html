        <p>When you use our Self Assessment online tax return, it automatically works out how much you’ll need to pay us.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">After adding your figures and checking everything is correct, you can view your calculation.
          This shows the amount you’re due to pay for this tax return. It will include:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Income Tax</li>
          <li>Class 4 National Insurance</li>
          <li>and Class 2 National Insurance contributions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>if they’re due.</p>
        <p>If the amount of Income Tax and Class 4 National Insurance is £1,000 or more, you have to make a payment on account.</p>
        <p>A payment on account is made twice a year on 31 January and 31 July to help you spread the cost of each year’s tax.</p>
        <p>Each payment is half of your last Income Tax and Class 4 National Insurance bill.  These payments are taken off the amount you’re due to pay the following year.</p>
        <p>If you’d like to see how the figures have been worked out in more detail, select ‘View and print your full calculation’.
        </p>


        <p class="govuk-body">This shows your:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>income</li>
          <li>personal allowance</li>
          <li>tax due</li>
          <li>Class 4 National Insurance</li>
          <li>Class 2 National Insurance</li>
          <li>and the total of any payments due</li>
        </ul>

       <p>Remember, these estimated payments don’t include any payments you’ve already made. You can print a copy of this for your own records.</p>
