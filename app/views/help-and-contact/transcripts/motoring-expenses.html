        <p>If you work for yourself, you might use your car, van or motorcycle for both business and personal use.
          You can claim business expenses for a number of things, including fuel, vehicle insurance and parking.
          You cannot claim for non-business driving costs, fines or travel between home and work.
        </p>

        <p>There are 2 ways of working out your motor expenses. Either by using the actual costs method, or a flat rate for business mileage.</p>

        <p>Whichever way you choose, you must continue to use it for that vehicle.</p>

        <p>If you use the actual costs method, you’ll need to know how many miles the vehicle has done during the relevant tax year – then work out what percentage of those were for business use only.</p>

        <p>For example, if the total running costs were £6,000, and 75% of the miles were for business use, you would include £4,500 on your Self Assessment tax return.</p>

        <p>If you’re using traditional accounting and the actual costs method, you can also claim a Capital Allowance for the purchase of the vehicle itself. You can find out more about Capital Allowances on
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
        </p>

        <p>If you claim expenses using the flat rate for business mileage method, you’ll find the current rates on
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
        </p>

        <p>You must keep a record of how many business miles you travel.</p>

        <p>The flat rate covers the whole cost of buying, running and maintaining the vehicle – so you can’t claim a capital allowance for its purchase or any other motoring expense.</p>

        <p>You can find more information about Self Assessment on
           <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
