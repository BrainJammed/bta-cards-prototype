        <p>After completing your online Self Assessment return, you’ll see your tax calculation and how much you’ll pay.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">There are lots of ways to pay this bill, and 2 deadlines for paying it by.
          Paying on time means you’ll avoid being charged interest and a late penalty. The deadlines are:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>31 January for your tax bill from the previous year and first payment on account</li>
          <li>and 31 July for your second payment on account.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To help you avoid missing the deadline, you can choose to make your payments earlier. If you prefer to pay regularly throughout the year,
          use a budget payment plan.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">For your payment to reach us the same or next day, pay by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Approving your payment through your online account</li>
          <li>Online or telephone banking, using faster payments</li>
          <li>CHAPS</li>
          <li>or your debit or corporate credit card online</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">For payment to reach us within 3 days, pay by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>Direct Debit</li>
          <li>or Bacs</li>
          <li>alternatively you can send a cheque through the post.</li>
        </ul>

       <p>After paying, you can view your HMRC online account to check payment has been received. It should show as paid within 7 working days.</p>

       <p>You can find more information about Self Assessment on
         <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>.
