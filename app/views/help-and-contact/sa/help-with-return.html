        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Self Assessment tax returns</h2>
        <p>Self Assessment is a system HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) uses to collect Income Tax.</p>
        <p>Income Tax is usually deducted automatically from wages, pensions and savings.</p>
        <p>People and businesses with other income must report it by filing a Self Assessment tax return.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">Self Assessment is used by:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>the self-employed</li>
          <li>sole traders</li>
          <li>individuals such as company directors</li>
          <li>partners in partnerships</li>
          <li>trustees</li>
          <li>other similar people</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you receive a tax return, or a notice to file, you must complete a return and submit it to HMRC.</p>

        <p>If you must file a tax return, you do so after the end of the tax year it applies to.</p>
        <p>The Self Assessment tax year is 6 April to 5 April. For the tax year 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021, you must file your return by 31 January 2022.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Basic record keeping when youâ€™re self-employed</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You must record any money going in and out of your business, whether the transaction is made:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>in person</li>
          <li>by phone</li>
          <li>online</li>
        </ul>



        <p>Keep your records on paper or digitally using a computer. These include items such as invoices,
          sale receipts, proof of purchases and bank statements. Remember your records must be accurate, clear and complete.
        </p>

        <p>Some software suppliers offer free record keeping apps for small businesses. How you keep your records will
          depend on whether you use the traditional or cash basis method of accounting, and how you work out your expenses.
        </p>

        <p>Youâ€™ll find it easier if you organise your income and expenses into categories and update these regularly.
          Remember to back up your files if youâ€™re keeping your records digitally.
        </p>

        <p>You must keep your business and personal transactions separate. It is not an allowable business expense to use money
          from your business for personal purposes.
        </p>

        <p>If youâ€™re VAT registered, youâ€™ll also need to keep records of how much VAT youâ€™ve paid your suppliers and charged your customers.</p>

        <p>If your income is above the VAT threshold, youâ€™ll need to submit your records to us using Making Tax Digital software.
        </p>

        <p>You must keep your records for at least 5 years after the 31 January submission deadline of the relevant tax year.
           HMRC may check your records to make sure youâ€™re paying the right amount of tax.
        </p>

        <p>Example: For the tax year 2019 to 2020, the submission deadline is 31 January 2021. Keep your records until at least 31 January 2026.
