    	<h3 class="heading-medium">Paying your Self Assessment tax bill</h3>
    	<p>The deadlines for paying are 31 January for a tax bill for the previous year and your first payment on account, and 31 July for your second payment on account. Make sure you pay HMRC on time. You will be charged interest and may have to pay a penalty if your payment is late. You do not have to wait until 31 January or 31 July to pay. If you do, you might miss the deadline, depending on how you pay.</p>

<h2 class="heading-large">Penalties and appeals</h2>

<p>You'll have a penalty showing on your account if you:</p>
<ul class="list list-bullet">
	<li>sent in your tax return late</li>
	<li>paid tax late</li>
	<li>didn't pay enough tax</li>
</ul>
<p>You can appeal if you have a 'reasonable excuse', for example you had an unexpected stay in hospital. You must appeal within 30 days of the date the penalty was sent to you.</p>
<p>You can't appeal a penalty online or by phone. Find out more about <a href="javascript:;">reasonable excuses</a> and <a href="javascript:;">how to appeal</a> by post.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Appeal against a penalty</h2>
<p>If you get your penalty notice by email from HMRC, you can either fill in <a href="javascript:;">form SA370</a> or write to HMRC, giving your reasons for appealing.</p>

<p>Send your form or letter to HMRC's<a href="javascript:;"> address for Self Assessment enquiries</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need a breakdown of your <a href="javascript:;">penalties</a> and <a href="javascript:;">interest</a>.</p>

<h2 class="heading-medium">Check the status of an appeal</h2>
<p>HMRC will send you contact details for the office dealing with your case within 15 days of receiving your appeal.</p>
