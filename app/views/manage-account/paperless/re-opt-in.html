                  <p>Whenever you have a new online letter, we will let you know by email. Because we cannot send all
                    letters online yet, you will still get some by post.</p>

                  <p><strong>Your responsibilities</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>1. Sign in to read</strong>
                    <br>Because email cannot include personal information, you need to sign in to HMRC online for the
                    details.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>2. Take action</strong>
                    <br>Some online tax letters need you to act, such as reminders to file a return, or to pay
                    penalties. Others are for information, such as changes to your personal tax code. <a
