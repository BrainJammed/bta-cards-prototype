          <p class="govuk-body">
            You’ll usually be sent a tax return if you’re registered as self-employed.
            But you can check if you need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return quickly and easily on GOV.UK,
            using the link at the end of this video.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            It’s not connected to HM Revenue and Customs online services so it’s completely anonymous.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            If you’re sent a tax return, or if you get an email or letter from HMRC telling you to complete one,
            you must do it - even if you don’t have any tax to pay. If you don’t send a tax return back by the deadline
            you may have to pay a penalty.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            If you used to send a tax return but don’t need to send one for the last tax year,
            contact HMRC to close your Self Assessment account.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            You must also tell HMRC if you’ve stopped being self-employed. You can do all this – and find out much more – on GOV.UK.
          </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">
            You can find more information about on GOV.UK.
